Building my project was not something easy to accomplish, but I made it through. For my project , I used three classes to make it work. I used the class Api, Drink(model) and Cli. In the class Api, I defined two method classes: self.get_drinks and self.get_drink_details. The first class method(self.get_drinks) takes an argument, which is a string and the second one take an argument which is an object.  In the cli class I defined multiple methods that allwed me to get the code functional. And the last class, Drink is the model of the project, it is allowed us to defined the attributes and make of a drink.
