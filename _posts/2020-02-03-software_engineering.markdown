I grew up where computers were absent and students were not awere of the good sides of computers . 

Once I arrived in the USA, I attended an institution where people coming from foreign countries could learn

how to speak, listen and read English. While in my country, everything was taught by an instructors, in that

institution we used softwares made by software engineers to  learn Englsih at a short time.That method

was enjoyable and interesting. In addition, not only in education that we see the impact of software

engineers, we notice their presence in banking system, shopping and connecting people from all over the

world. For instance, we do not need to carry money because programmers made available virtual wallet, we

can connect with family members without being in the same country or twon through Facebook. Softwares 

engineers, usually called programmers  have a huge impact in  our life, nowadays. Seeing that impact, I 


decided, too, to become a software engineer to also make  an impact to my surroundings. Hopefully, that 

desire and passion will come to live, one day.
